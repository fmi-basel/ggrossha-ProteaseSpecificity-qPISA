Massively parallel quantification of substrate turnover defines protease subsite cooperativity Rajani Kanth Gudipati, Dimos Gaidatzis, Jan Seebacher, Sandra Muehlhaeusser, Georg Kempf, Simone Cavadini, Daniel Hess, Charlotte Soneson and Helge Gro√ühans

This R script determineSpecificity_dpp4.r reproduces the figures and tables related to the inference of the enzyme specificity of DPP4. The analysis of the DPF-3 experiment can be performed by replacing the DPP4 peptide log2 fold changes by the DPF-3 peptide log2 fold changes within the script (see comments in the script).
